I got stuck in adding songs data to database , because artwork field have attribute as image which i tried to add in database(mongodb) but showing error . i searched it online also but could not find solution of it. as a result i could not create top 10 songs and top 10 artist page. i thought of using other database but time is less. so i sumbit it.
